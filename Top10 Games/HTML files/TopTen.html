    <h1>The 10 Best Video Games of 2022</h1>
    <div class="TopDiv">
        <h3>Elden Ring</h3>
        <p>
            When you’re talking about the best games of 2022, Elden Ring has to be at the
            top of the list. The hype surrounding this release was no joke. And after two
            consecutive wins for the most anticipated game of the year, it seemed fitting
            that Elden Ring was crowned game of the year at the 2022 Game Awards.

            Elden Ring is a masochistic Souls-like experience with monster designs and a
            high-fantasy storyline that are nothing short of epic. Elden Ring is a true
            masterpiece. But we must warn you it is not for the faint of heart.

        <h3>God of War Ragnarök</h3>
        <p>
            Gamers had sky-high expectations for God of War Ragnarök, and it is safe to say that
            Santa Monica Studio’s action-adventure title exceeded them. The long-running God of
            War series has become one of PlayStation's hallmark franchises, and the latest entry
            perfectly wraps up the Norse saga.

            God of War Ragnarök is a perfect example of everything fans love about the series.
            It has unapologetically fast-paced and satisfying combat and a deeply engaging
            storyline that is flawlessly executed.

        <h3>Stray</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone loves cats, and Stray captures the likeness of these furry companions with almost
            scary accuracy. Everything about the adorable protagonist's mannerisms and overall execution
            makes it clear to any player that Stray is an absolute labor of love.

            Stray is an indie action-adventure puzzle game from BlueTwelve Studios. The game explores
            themes of destruction and loss as you unravel the mystery of a post-apocalyptic world with
            your adorable robot companion, B-12.

            Stray is a short but sweet adventure, taking only about 10 hours to complete.
            Make sure you start playing it earlier in the day, however. Because once you begin,
            the urge to binge the whole game in one go is seriously strong.

        <h3>Horizon Forbidden West</h3>
        <p>
            Horizon Forbidden West is another masterpiece that hit shelves in 2022. This sprawling
            RPG follows the protagonist Aloy as she continues her war against the massive deranged
            machines that are wreaking havoc in her world.

            Horizon Forbidden West is the second installation in the Horizon franchise, and
            it is everything the first game was and more. The machines are bigger, badder,
            and more epic, as is Aloy herself. The combat in Horizon Forbidden West is extremely
            smooth, and the story is just as incredible as the massive open world the game takes place in.

        <h3>Ghostwire: Tokyo</h3>
        <p>
            Ghostwire Tokyo takes ranged first-person combat and drenches it in Japanese culture and
            mythology. The game takes place in a deserted Shibuya, a stark contrast to the thriving
            cultural hub that exists there today. Here the area has been blanketed in a fog that has
            left it populated by spirits instead of the hundreds of busybodies that usually fill the streets.

            What FPS usually means in gaming is guns and realistic shooting mechanics.
            But in Ghostwire: Tokyo, the combat is far more stylized and magical than that.
            You can harness multiple elemental attacks to make quick work of the spirits that
            plague the once densely populated city. There is an element of artistic flare to the
            combat as the protagonist's hands dance across the screen while ripping out the cores
            of their enemies. This makes the gameplay unique and unforgettable.

        <h3>A Plague Tale: Requiem</h3>
        <p>
            If you are over all the aggressive action and would rather take a more stealthy approach
            to your next adventure, A Plague Tale: Requiem would be a perfect choice. The game takes
            place in a horrendously infested 14th Century France and sees the player character, Amicia,
            making her way through hordes of plague rats and murderous guards whose only mission is to
            kill both her and her brother.

            The story is harrowing, to say the least, but so brilliant that it easily makes up for the
            emotional trauma and therapy you may or may not have to fork out for once the story is over.
            Our only advice is to maybe stay away from this one if you're afraid of rats.

        <h3>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h3>
        <p>
            The deceivingly adorable pink ball of pure power that is Kirby has become synonymous
            with Nintendo over the years. Kirby has received many entries on every generation of
            Nintendo hardware since the early 90s. But this year, it was different.

            Kirby and the Forgotten Land completely revolutionized the Kirby franchise, bringing
            the beloved mascot to life in full 3D. The series has always been well-known for being
            more on the easy side. This made it perfect for children but didn’t pose much of a challenge
            for adults.

            Kirby and the Forgotten Land, however, features intuitive level design and much more
            challenging boss fights that make the game far more engaging for older players. Kirby
            and the Forgotten Land may be the first 3D platformer in the franchise, but hopefully,
            it is not the last.

        <h3>Splatoon 3</h3>
        <p>
            Splatoon is one of Nintendo’s newest IPs, but that didn't stop it from quickly rising up
            the ranks to become one of its staple franchises in record time. Splatoon 3 sold over 7
            million copies within the first three months, solidifying its spot as not only one of the
            best Nintendo Switch games of 2022, but one of the best games of 2022 in general.

            The immense success of Splatoon 3 can be attributed to its addictive and fun gameplay.
            Splatoon is like many other popular online FPS games, but with a coat of paint that can't
            be described as anything other than pure Nintendo wholesomeness.

            Nintendo stripped away the violence and gore that are naturally associated with FPS titles
            and essentially made an online paintball game. Splatoon 3 is fast-paced, seriously fun, and
            engaging for all ages.

        <h3>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</h3>
        <p>
            For RPG fans, the Xenoblade series has been overlooked for too long. Despite containing
            some of the richest stories, worlds, and systems in the genre today, it just couldn’t get
            the recognition it deserved outside of niche circles. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 was the
            mainstream moment fans had always hoped for, and it was completely earned. The Switch
            exclusive offers a rich story about soldiers coming to terms with who their true enemies
            are: the oppressive powers that see them as pawns in a conflict they don’t need to die for.
            With stunning landscapes, fully realized character arcs, and excellent MMO-like combat,
            Xenoblade Chronicles 3 made sure that no one passes over the series again. ~ Giovanni
            Colantonio.

        <h3>Sifu</h3>
        <p>
            The hunt for the assassins of your family will take you through the hidden corners
            of the city, from gang-ridden suburbs to the cold hallways of corporate towers. You
            have one day, and countless enemies on your way. Time will be the price to pay.

            Careful positioning and clever use of the environment to your advantage are key
            to your survival. Throwable objects, makeshift weapons, windows and ledges.
            The odds are stacked against you, you will have to use everything at your disposal to prevail.

            Kung Fu is a path for the body and the mind. Learn from your errors, unlock unique skills,
            and find the strength within yourself to master the devastating techniques of Pak-Mei Kung-Fu.
